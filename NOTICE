ALGORITHM NOTES

The autostereogram generation algorithm implemented in this software is based
on well-established computer graphics techniques for single-image random-dot
stereogram (SIRDS) generation, first popularized in the 1990s.

The core algorithm uses depth-map-based disparity calculation and scanline
processing, which are common techniques in the public domain.

No patented algorithms or proprietary techniques are used.
